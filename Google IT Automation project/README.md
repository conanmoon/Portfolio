<h1> Automate updating catalog information </h1>

<h5> This part of portfolio was my submission to the final project of the "Google IT Automation with Python" specialization on Coursera. </h5>
<h5>*The mission statements below are slightly modified from that of the actual assessment from the specialization on Coursera, in order to clearly show what types of data and files can be associated with the real-world automation tasks; making it convenient for viewing all of them on this GitiHub repository without having to refer to any other resource, unlike how some data had to be fetched online from an external link that is only temporarily available in the original assessment. </h5>
<h5> All of the scripts and files are shared on this GitHub repository with the agreements of both Coursera and Google, the co-providers of the course "Automating Real-World Tasks with Python."</h5>

<h2> Mission </h2>
<h3> Part 1 </h3>
Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. 
But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format with no thumbnails and being too large. Oof! 
You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. 
ou’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch, and upload it to the company website.
<h4> Files for this part: "process_image.py" and "image_upload.py"</h4>
<h4> Data used for this part: files in "image/raw_images/" folder </h4>
<h4> Files generated in this part: files in "images/processed_images/" folder </h4>

<h3> Part 2 </h3>
You work for an online fruits store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. 
The suppliers send the data of an associated description of the products in file (.txt format). 
The text needs to be turned into an HTML file that shows the product description. 
The contents of the HTML file need to be uploaded to a web service that is already running using Django. 
You also need to gather the name and weight of all fruits from the .txt files and use a Python request to upload it to your Django server.
You will create a Python script that will process the descriptions and then update your company's online website to add the new products.
Once the task is complete, the supplier should be notified with an email that indicates the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded. 
The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs).
Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we want to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong.
<h4> Files for this part: "description_upload.py", "reports.py", "emails.py", "report_email.py", and "health_check.py"</h4>
<h4> Data used for this part: files in "descriptions" folder </h4>
<h4> Files generated in this part: "processed.pdf" in the project folder</h4>
